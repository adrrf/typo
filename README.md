**tYpO** is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed for document creation, offering a modern approach to formatted text writing.

### Objective

Create a document authoring system similar to Markdown and LaTeX, but with enhanced features and visual editing capabilities.

### Technology Stack

- **Ecore**
- **Sirius**
- **Xtext**
- **Xtend**

## Model

The tYpO language is built upon a well-structured metamodel that defines the core elements of document creation:

</p>

The model encompasses various document elements including:

- Document structure (title, author, date, tldr)
- Content blocks (sections, paragraphs, images, code blocks)
- Inline formatting (bold, italic, links)
- Lists and itemization

## Visual Editor

The project includes a visual editor built with Eclipse Sirius, providing an intuitive graphical interface for document modeling.

</p>

The visual editor allows users to:

- Create and modify document structures graphically
- Visualize relationships between document elements
- Edit properties through dedicated forms
- Real-time preview of document structure

## Text-to-Model (T2M)

The tYpO DSL provides a clean, intuitive syntax for creating documents. Here are some examples:

### Document Structure

```typo
doc {
 title: "My Document"
 author: "John Doe"
 date: "2025-05-22"
 tldr: "Brief description"
 // content blocks here
}
```

### Sections and Paragraphs

```typo
+section "Introduction"
+sub "Overview"
+p *"This is normal text " ~bold"with bold" *" and " ~italic"italic" *" formatting."
```

### Images and Code

```typo
+img {
    url: "path/to/image.png"
    width: 500
    height: 300
    caption: "Figure caption"
}

+code {
    language: "java"
    text: "public class Hello { ... }"
}
```

### Lists and Links

```typo
+list
- *"First item"
- ~bold"Second item"
- ~link { url: "https://example.com" text: "Link text" }
```

## Model-to-Text (M2T)

The tYpO system includes multiple code generators that transform your models into various output formats:

- Markdown (.md) - For GitHub, documentation sites
- LaTeX (.tex) - For academic papers, books
- HTML (.html) - For web publishing

This multi-target approach allows you to write once and publish to multiple formats, maximizing content reusability.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of a tYpO document:

```typo
doc {
    title: "My First Document"
    author: "Jane Smith"
    date: "2025-05-22"
    tldr: "A simple example document"

    +section "Hello World"
    +p *"Welcome to " ~bold"tYpO" *"! This is a simple example."

    +list
    - *"Easy to write"
    - *"Multiple output formats"
    - *"Visual editing support"
}
```
